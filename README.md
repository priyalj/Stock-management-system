# Stock-management-system
Conceptualized & Created a GUI-based project for managing the stock of a shop  and new orders placed to the suppliers along with supplier, transaction details. Performed various CRUD operations on the records and successfully generated & displayed the results in a tree view widget. Technologies used included Python language, MySQL database server and tkinter library. It has a login system with an option of 'forgot password'. There are two windows which can be visited using the option in the menu. One window is to manage and display the stock already available and the second window provides information about the products whose order has been placed to a particular supplier. This project improves work efficiency and saves time.
